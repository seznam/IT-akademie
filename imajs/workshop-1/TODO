1.d implement the createEntities() method to convert the array of entity data into array of entities using the
    createEntity() method
1.e the home page should now display a list of movies

2.a open app/component/molecule/movie/Movie.jsx
2.b update the markup according the instructions in the comments
2.c the movie listing will look much better now, and we are linking each movie to its movie detail page!

3. Implementing the movie detail page
3.a open app/model/movie/MovieResource.js
3.b implement the getMovie(url) method as instructed in the comments. The url argument will be a URL slug for the movie
    to retrieve
3.c open app/page/movie/MovieController.js
3.d implement the load() method as instructed in the comments
3.e open app/component/atom/rating/Rating.jsx

4.c open app/page/home/HomeController.js
4.d create a new method named loadState
4.e move the contents of the load() method to the loadState() method
4.f make the load() method call the loadState() method and return the result
4.g add the update() method that calls the loadState() method and returns the result

5. Improving the image loading UX using the ima-ui-atoms package
5.a open app/build.js
5.b add './node_modules/ima-ui-atoms/dist/*.less' to the less array after the './app/assets/less/layout.less' item
5.c add 'ima-ui-atoms' and 'infinite-circle' to the common array in the vendors object
5.d open app/config/bind.js
5.e import UIComponentHelper from 'ima-ui-atoms'
5.f add the $UIComponentHelper: oc.get(UIComponentHelper) line to the $Utils object
5.g open app/component/molecule/movie/Movie.jsx
5.h import the Image component from 'ima-ui-atoms'
5.i replace the <img> element with the <Image> component, add the layout="responsive" prop
